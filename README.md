# Browser-Plugin-for-User-Privacy-Through-Randomised-VPN-Connections-for-Each-Browser-Tab

This research project focuses on developing a browser plugin that enhances user privacy by establishing randomised VPN connections for each opened browser tab. Research various VPN protocols and analyse their suitability. The project will require developing the plugin using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while ensuring compatibility with popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Evaluate the plugin's efficacy in preserving user privacy by conducting experiments that measure its ability to prevent tracking and profiling by third-party websites and services. Additionally, the project will address potential performance and latency issues arising from using multiple VPN connections and develop strategies to optimise the user experience.
